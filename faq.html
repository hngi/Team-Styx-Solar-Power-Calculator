    				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is Solar Energy (Power)?</a>
    				<div class="cd-faq-content">
    				<p>Solar power is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect.
    						Sunlight is converted into electricity using solar panels. It can be used to power home and office appliances directly and also the converted electricity can be stored in batteries to save power for further use. Excess energy harnessed from the panels can be exported to the grid. In the case of a grid-tied solar unit.

    				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Are there any Pros and Cons of solar energy?</a>
    				<div class="cd-faq-content">
    					<p>Solar energy offers great benefits both financially and environmentally. Money for electricity bills will be saved and increasing the electricity rate in the future will be protected. It also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which plays a role in climate change and air pollution.
    							The solar panel has no negative effect on your roof; instead, it has been known to help increase the value of the house when putting it up for sale.

    				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why use a Solar Calculator?</a>
    				<div class="cd-faq-content">
    					<p>A solar calculator helps you calculate with precise accuracy how many kW system sizes are required to power your selected appliances. With this information, you can know the cost of the system and make adjustments where necessary. Worthy of note is to power only the most important appliances on a solar power system.
    							Calculation is required to get a fair or exact estimate of solar components needed to power your appliances and home. All appliances that require electricity to run and that will be used in your home (kitchen, living room, bathroom, etc.). All electrical appliances are rated in KWH, which tells the amount of electricity the particular appliance consumes per hour.

    					<div class="cd-faq-content">
    						<p>here can only be estimates as the installation cost varies considerably. This depends on your energy demands. In addition, how much independence you are willing to go for.
    								The only cost is the cost of initial components and installation. No subsequent subscription or bills are required to have access to power generated.

    				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Is solar power clean or green energy?</a>
    				<div class="cd-faq-content">
    					<p>Solar Energy is both green and clean, as it has no harmful effects on the environment. In addition, solar power is a stable power source when inverted and excess power is stored to be used later.
    							Solar power is a renewable resource, which means there is so much of it freely available we never have to dig for coal or refine other toxic energy sources just to keep the lights on. Solar energy reduces your carbon footprint by decreasing greenhouse gas emissions (which contribute to climate change). Since it does not produce any pollution, it also means we will have less harmful pollutants in our air, land, and water.

    				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Are solar panels difficult to maintain?</a>
    				<div class="cd-faq-content">
    					<p>Solar panels are easier to maintain than your properties HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning), appliances, and maybe even your cell phone. That is because solar panels have zero moving parts to break.
    							The most you will have to do to maintain your solar panels is make sure they are free of dust, pollen, leaves, and other debris. Whatever is obstructing your panels will make for less efficient energy production. You will also need to trim branches that may get in the way of your solar panels and dust off heavy snow. That is not so hard, right.

    				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Will my solar panels generate electricity during cloudy, rainy, or snowy days? What about at night?</a>
    				<div class="cd-faq-content">
    					<p>Your solar panels do not need sunshine, per se, to generate electricity as much as they need direct, unobstructed access to the sun’s UV rays.
    							Similar to how your skin still tans when it’s overcast outside, your solar panels will still generate electricity during cloudy, rainy, or snowy days — they just won’t produce as much energy as they do during clear days. Solar panels do not generate electricity at night since the sun is not out. This is when staying connected to the power grid comes in handy, as you will still have electricity to Netflix and chill.
